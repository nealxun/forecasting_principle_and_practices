abstract = {Marketing managers routinely use purchase intentions to predict sales. The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors associated with an increased or decreased correlation between purchase intentions and actual purchasing. Using two studies, we examine the data collected from a wide range of different settings which reflect the real world diversity in how intentions studies are conducted. The results indicate that intentions are more correlated with purchases: 1) for existing products than for new ones; 2) for durable goods than for non-durable goods; 3) for short than for long time horizons; 4) when respondents are asked to provide intentions to purchase specific brands or models than when they are asked to provide intentions to buy at the product category level; 5) when purchases are measured in terms of trial rates than when they are measured in terms of total market sales; and 6) when purchase intentions are collected in a comparative mode than when they are collected monadically.},

abstract = {Judgmental adjustments of statistical forecasts are widely used for improving forecast accuracy. Despite the overall effectiveness of this method, it may allow forecasters to introduce biases in statistical forecasts when they judgmentally adjust them. This paper considers three types of bias: (1) optimism bias, (2) anchoring bias, and (3) overreaction bias. We explore the effects of particular individual differences, specifically personality, motivational orientation, and work locus of control, on forecasting biases. The results indicate that a forecaster’s personality and motivational orientation have significant effects on forecasting biases, whereas work locus of control has no effect on forecasting biases. Our analysis further indicates that experience, work locus of control and motivational orientation drive a forecaster’s willingness to judgmentally adjust a statistical forecast.},

abstract = {Purchase intentions are routinely used to forecast sales of existing products and services. While past studies have shown that intentions are predictive of sales, they have only examined the absolute accuracy of intentions, not their accuracy relative to other forecasting methods. For example, no research has been able to demonstrate that intentions-based forecasts can improve upon a simple extrapolation of past sales trends. We examined the relative accuracy of four methods that forecast sales from intentions. We tested these methods using four data sets involving different products and time horizons; one of French automobile sales, two of US automobile sales, and one of US wireless services. For all four products and time horizons, each of the four intentions-based forecasting methods was more accurate than an extrapolation of past sales. Combinations of these forecasting methods using equal weights lead to even greater accuracy, with error rates about one-third lower than extrapolations of past sales. Thus, it appears that purchase intentions can provide better forecasts than a simple extrapolation of past sales trends. While the evidence from the current study contradicts the findings of an earlier study, the consistency of the results in our study suggest that intentions are a valuable input to sales forecasts.},

Four general principles that should help to enhance the role of scenario planning when predictability is low are discussed: (i) challenging mental frames, (ii) understanding human motivations, (iii) augmenting scenario planning through adopting the approach of crisis management, and (iv) assessing the flexibility, diversity, and insurability of strategic options in a structured option-against-scenario evaluation.

Correlating the weights of the expert forecasts in these linear combinations with the experts’ experience and behaviour shows that more experience and modest deviation from model forecasts gives most weight of the expert forecast. When the rate of bracketing increases, we notice a convergence to equal weights. We show that these results are robust across 12 different forecast horizons.},

Journal of Forecasting 4, 1-28], I reviewed the research in exponential smoothing since the original work by Brown and Holt. This paper brings the state of the art up to date. The most important theoretical advance is the invention of a complete statistical rationale for exponential smoothing based on a new class of state-space models with a single source of error. The most important practical advance is the development of a robust method for smoothing damped multiplicative trends. We also have a new adaptive method for simple smoothing, the first such method to demonstrate credible improved forecast accuracy over fixed-parameter smoothing. Longstanding confusion in the literature about whether and how to renormalize seasonal indices in the Holt-Winters methods has finally been resolved. There has been significant work in forecasting for inventory control, including the development of new predictive distributions for total lead-time demand and several improved versions of Croston's method for forecasting intermittent time series. Regrettably, there has been little progress in the identification and selection of exponential smoothing methods. The research in this area is best described as inconclusive, and it is still difficult to beat the application of a damped trend to every time series.},

Upon analyzing various forecasts in a large database, using various models, forecast samples and accuracy measures, we demonstrate that experts’ knowledge, on average, apparently is not associated with variables which are systematically omitted from the statistical models. We also find that the formal inclusion of past judgment can be helpful in cases when the model performs poorly. This can lead to an improved interaction between models and experts, and we discuss the design features of a forecasting support system.},

@article{Song2012,
abstract = {This paper introduces a web-based tourism demand forecasting system (TDFS) that is designed to forecast the demand for Hong Kong tourism, as measured by tourist arrivals, total and sectoral tourist expenditures, and the demand for hotel rooms. The TDFS process comprises three stages–preliminary data analysis, the generation of quantitative forecasts and judgmental adjustments–which correspond to the three key system components: the data module, the quantitative forecasting module and the judgmental forecasting module, respectively. These stages (modules) interact with one another. This paper focuses on a recent case study that illustrates the functional ability of the TDFS as a support system, providing accurate forecasts of the demand for Hong Kong tourism. Specifically, the quantitative forecasts are generated by the autoregressive distributed lag model, then adjusted by a panel of experts comprising postgraduate students and academic staff. The results show that this combination of quantitative and judgmental forecasts improves the overall forecasting accuracy.},

@article{Fildes2007,
abstract = {Accurate forecasts are crucial to successful organizational planning. In 2001, 40 international experts published a set of principles to guide best practices in forecasting. Some of these principles relate to the use of management judgment. Most organizations use judgment at some stage in their forecasting process, but do they do so effectively? Although judgment can lead to significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, it can also be biased and inconsistent. The principles show how forecasters should use judgment and assess its effectiveness. We conducted a survey of 149 forecasters to examine the use of judgment based on these established principles and to investigate whether their forecasting procedures were consistent with the principles. In addition, we conducted four in-depth case studies. Although we found examples of good practice, we also discovered that many organizations would improve forecast accuracy if they followed basic principles such as limiting judgmental adjustments of quantitative forecasts, requiring managers to justify their adjustments in writing, and assessing the results of judgmental interventions.},

abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;One of the key assumptions in weights of evidence
(WE) modelling is that the predictor patterns have to be conditionally
independent. When this assumption is violated, WE posterior probability
estimates are likely to be biased upwards. In this paper, a formal
expression for the bias of the contrasts will be derived. It will
be shown that this bias has an intuitive and convenient interpretation.
A modified WE model will then be developed, where the bias is corrected
using the correlation structure of the predictor patterns. The new
model is termed the conditional dependence adjusted weights of evidence
(CDAWE) model. It will be demonstrated via a simulation study that
the CDAWE model significantly outperforms the existing WE model when
conditional independence is violated, and it is on par with logistic
regression, which does not assume conditional independence. Furthermore,
it will be argued that, in the presence of conditional dependence
between predictor patterns, weights variance estimates from WE are
likely to understate the true level of uncertainty. It will be argued
that weights variance estimates from CDAWE, which are also bias-corrected,
can properly address this issue.},
